# cheesecalc

This is a quick and dirty calculator for preparing mac and cheese using ratios of sodium citrate, liquid, cheese, and pasta.

For convenience this is packaged as a nix flake.
Use `nix run github:justinrubek/cheesecalc`.
Alternatively clone the repo and use `nix run` directly within the project.

The program has a help page `nix run . -- --help`
